# Location Profile

## The Hostel

**Name:** The Fisherman's Rest (Sjomannahvildin)
**Type:** Budget / Historic
**Star Rating:** 2.5
**Price Range:** $35-$60 per night

### History
Built in 1974 on the ruins of a fishing village that dated back to the 1600s. The village was abandoned after too many residents vanished - folklore attributed it to huldufolk (hidden people). The hostel's basement incorporates the original stone foundation of a structure that existed before the fishing village. Local records suggest the site was a known "crossing place" in pre-Christian Iceland.

### Architecture
- **Style:** Functional 1970s construction atop ancient stone foundation, weathered by coastal elements
- **Floors:** 2 above ground, 1 basement
- **Total beds:** 28
- **Notable features:** Original foundation visible in basement, unusual angles in certain rooms, geothermal heating

### The Death Location (Specific)
**Where exactly does the death occur?**
The basement broom closet. Built into the oldest part of the foundation, it has a wooden door that looks like it was added much later than the stone archway it covers. The interior is approximately 6 feet deep - sometimes. During geomagnetic storms, the interior changes.

## The City

**City:** Near Hofn
**Country:** Iceland
**Population:** 2,100 (Hofn municipality)
**Known for:** Vatnajokull glacier access, lobster/langoustine, isolation, Northern Lights, dramatic landscapes

### Geography
- **Climate:** Subarctic oceanic, cold and windy year-round
- **Terrain:** Coastal, glaciers inland, volcanic activity, geothermally active
- **Weather during story:** Late autumn - limited daylight (5-6 hours), frequent storms, prime aurora season

### Culture
- **Language(s):** Icelandic, English widely spoken
- **Religion(s):** Lutheran nominally, but strong undercurrent of folk belief in hidden people (huldufolk)
- **Customs relevant to story:** Icelanders don't deny huldufolk exist - roads are diverted around elf stones, building projects consult seers. This isn't superstition but cultural continuity.

### Tourist Scene
- **Backpacker popularity:** Medium - it's remote but Ring Road accessible
- **Type of tourists:** Nature seekers, aurora hunters, glacier tours, adventurous travelers
- **Danger level:** Low for crime, moderate for environment (weather changes rapidly)

## Sensory Environment

### Sounds
- Morning: Wind, seabirds, distant waves, silence
- Afternoon: Same, possibly rain against windows
- Night: Wind (always), occasional aurora-related phenomena (reports of humming)
- Unique sounds: The basement has a sub-audible vibration that some guests claim to feel rather than hear

### Smells
- Hostel: Geothermal sulfur (faint), damp wool, fish from kitchen, old wood
- Street: Salt air, glacier-cold wind, occasional sulfur
- Specific to death location: The basement smells older than the building - stone and time

### Textures
- Surfaces: Rough stone in basement, worn wood floors above, functional furniture
- Climate feel: Cold seeping through walls, warmth only near heaters, constant awareness of the elements

### Tastes
- Local food: Langoustine, lamb, skyr, dried fish, rye bread
- Hostel offerings: Basic breakfast, kitchen for self-cooking, local restaurant recommendations

### Visual Details
- Colors: Gray stone, gray sea, gray sky, white glaciers, occasional green aurora
- Light quality: In autumn, golden-gray twilight most of the day, then darkness
- Distinctive visuals: The aurora when it appears, the vastness of the landscape, the ancient stonework

## The Staff

### Reception
**Name:** Bjorn Sigurdsson
**Description:** 62, third generation to run the hostel, knows about the closet, bound by family oath to maintain it
**Role in death:** Passive enabler - gives subtle warnings but won't directly intervene; believes some people are meant to find the threshold

### Other Staff
| Role | Name | Notable Trait |
|------|------|---------------|
| Cleaner | Helga | Won't enter the basement alone, won't explain why |
| Security | None | Remote location, minimal crime |
| Bar/Kitchen | Bjorn's wife, Sigrid | Makes offerings at the basement door each new moon |
| Manager | Bjorn | Has keys to the basement, rarely uses them |

### Staff Knowledge
Bjorn's family has maintained the hostel and the threshold for three generations. They don't understand what the closet is, but they know it's real. They've learned the patterns: storms, certain times of night, certain types of people who are drawn to it. They warn when they can, but they believe the threshold calls to those it wants.

## Hostel Atmosphere

### Day Vibe
Quiet, functional, guests come and go for glacier tours. The kind of hostel that's a base camp, not a destination.

### Night Vibe
Eerily quiet. Guests often go to bed early, tired from outdoor activities. Some report vivid dreams. The basement makes sounds that could be settling, could be something else.

### Guest Demographics
Adventurous backpackers, glacier tour clients, Ring Road travelers, occasional researchers (geologists, aurora photographers), and people like Erik - drawn to the location for reasons they can't explain.

### Reputation
"Basic but well-located." Reviews mention the helpful owner, the good glacier access, the atmospheric building. Occasional mentions of "strange dreams" or "weird basement." One review (deleted): "Don't go in the closet."

## Practical Details

### Getting There
Fly to Reykjavik, rent a car, drive the Ring Road east (6+ hours). No public transport to this area. The hostel appears on GPS; locals will give directions if asked but some won't discuss it.

### Check-in Process
Bjorn greets guests personally. He studies their faces. He asks why they're visiting. Most get normal check-in. Guests who seem... different get a longer look. Erik got a longer look.

### Rules
- No going to the basement after midnight
- Respect quiet hours (10 PM - 7 AM)
- Don't prop the basement door open
- If you hear humming, go back upstairs

### Amenities
- [x] Wi-Fi (quality: weak but functional)
- [x] Kitchen
- [x] Lockers
- [x] Laundry (in the basement...)
- [ ] Pool
- [ ] Bar
- [x] Northern Lights deck
- [x] Tours offered (glacier, ice cave)
- [x] Other: Geothermal heating, northern lights wake-up service

## Real-World Research

### Accuracy Notes
- Iceland's huldufolk traditions are genuine and culturally important
- Geomagnetic storms do cause measurable phenomena
- The east coast is indeed more remote and has a different character than Reykjavik
- Hofn is a real town known for langoustine

### Cultural Sensitivity
- Icelandic beliefs about hidden people should be portrayed with respect, not mockery
- The isolation and danger of Iceland's weather is real
- The thin population and community bonds are important cultural elements

### Sources
- "The Little Book of the Hidden People" by Alda Sigmundsdottir
- Academic studies on Icelandic folklore
- Geological surveys of Iceland's geomagnetic activity
- Travel accounts of Ring Road journeys
