# Victim Profile

## Basic Information

**Full Name:** Erik Lindqvist
**Nickname/Handle:** @LiminalErik
**Age:** 27
**Nationality:** Swedish
**Occupation:** Physics PhD dropout / "Independent Researcher" / Bookstore employee

## Archetype
**Primary:** Obsessive Seeker

**Secondary traits:** Failed academic, conspiracy-adjacent thinker, social outcast who found community in fringe theory forums

## The Fatal Flaw
**Core Flaw:** Obsessive Curiosity

**How it manifests:**
- Has spent three years mapping "dimensional thin spots" around the world
- Believes he's discovered patterns that mainstream physics ignores
- Cannot resist investigating anomalies, even dangerous ones
- Prioritizes "knowing" over his own safety

**How it kills them:**
His certainty that he's finally found a real portal, combined with his inability to resist testing it, leads him to step through without any way to return.

## Physical Appearance
- **Height/Build:** 6'1", thin and slightly stooped from hours over books and screens
- **Hair:** Dirty blond, perpetually disheveled
- **Distinguishing features:** Wire-frame glasses, dark circles from irregular sleep, fingers stained with pen ink
- **Typical outfit:** Layers of practical clothing, hiking boots, always carries a messenger bag with equipment

## Personality

### Positive Traits (that get twisted)
1. Brilliant analytical mind - becomes obsession with patterns that may not exist
2. Genuine wonder at the universe - becomes need to penetrate mysteries that should remain closed

### Negative Traits (that seal their fate)
1. Dismissive of warnings - convinced his knowledge is superior
2. Compulsive need to prove himself right - after academic rejection, needs validation

### Pet Peeves
- People who accept reality at face value
- The scientific establishment that "couldn't see" his work
- Being called a conspiracy theorist (he prefers "independent researcher")

### Fears
- Surface fear: That his theories are wrong and he's wasted his life
- Deeper fear: That his theories are right and he's not brave enough to prove it

## Background

### Origin Story
Child prodigy from Stockholm, entered PhD program at Lund University at 22. His thesis on dimensional membrane theory was rejected as "unfounded speculation." Rather than accept conventional physics, he dropped out and began traveling to locations he believes have "thin spots" where dimensions intersect. Funded by savings, occasional bookstore work, and a small community of believers who donate to his research.

### Why They Travel
Mapping the geography of the impossible. He believes Iceland sits on a major dimensional fault line due to geothermal and magnetic anomalies.

### How They Ended Up at This Hostel
His data pointed to this exact location. Built on old fishing village ruins, geothermally active area, multiple historical accounts of people vanishing. The hostel was built in the 1970s but claims date back centuries.

## Voice & Speech

### Vocabulary
- Uses words like: "membrane," "threshold," "thin spot," "interdimensional," "eigenstate"
- Avoids words like: "magic," "supernatural," "believe" (prefers "know" and "evidence")
- Catchphrases: "The math doesn't lie," "They're not missing, they're just... elsewhere"

### Speech Pattern
- Rapid when excited, technical jargon-heavy
- Tends toward monologue when discussing his theories
- Swedish accent becomes stronger under stress

### Internal Monologue Style
Constantly analyzing, categorizing, looking for patterns. Even his emotions are processed analytically.

## Digital Presence

### Social Media
- **Platform of choice:** Discord (for research community), obscure forums
- **Follower count:** 4,000 true believers on his research channel
- **Posting style:** Dense theoretical posts, location documentation, equipment reviews
- **Last post before death:** Photo of the hostel with caption: "Readings are off the scale. This is it. Will document tomorrow. If I don't post again, I found what I was looking for."

### Online vs Reality
Online he's a respected figure in his niche community; in reality, he's lonely, rejected by mainstream science, and increasingly unstable

## Relationships

### Family
- Parents supportive but worried; they've watched his obsession consume him
- Sister stopped talking to him after he missed her wedding chasing a "lead"

### Friends
- Online community members who share his interests
- No close in-person friends; lost them during his academic collapse

### Romantic
- Brief relationship in grad school ended when his obsession took over
- Hasn't dated in three years

### At the Hostel
- Keeps to himself, takes constant measurements
- Other guests find him off-putting, talk about "that weird guy with the equipment"

## The Day They Die

### Morning
Pre-dawn equipment checks, reviewing data from overnight sensors, hands trembling with excitement

### Their Last Normal Moment
Eating breakfast in the hostel kitchen, actually making small talk with another guest about the Northern Lights, allowing himself a moment of normal human connection

### Final Thoughts
"The math was right. It's beautiful. Oh god, it's so much bigger than I thought. Where does it go? I have to know. I have to - "

### Last Words
"I have to know." (whispered to himself as he steps through)
